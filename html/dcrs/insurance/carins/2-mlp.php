<h4>Some useful information on how this cover works</h4>
<p>Cover is provided following a road traffic accident involving your insured car in the EU where somebody else is responsible for the accident.</p>
<p>The cover is for up to £100,000 of legal costs and expenses to help you and your passengers claim compensation for personal injury and uninsured losses, such as your policy excess or lost earnings, from the person responsible.</p>
<p>Brand Legal Guard will, if considered necessary, appoint a specialist solicitor to pursue your claim.</p>
<p>Cover is only provided if your claim is more likely than not to be successful and any judgements are more likely than not to be enforced. Cover is not provided if you appoint a solicitor without first contacting Brand Legal Guard.</p>
<p>The legal protection section of the policy is underwritten by Ageas Insurance Limited.</p>
<p>For full details of cover and exclusions, please see the policy documents.</p></div></div>
